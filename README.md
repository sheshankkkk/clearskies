# ClearSkies: Air Quality Prediction and Classification

ClearSkies is a machine learning project that uses the UCI Air Quality dataset to:

- Predict pollutant levels using regression models.
- Classify overall air quality into risk categories for health risk assessment.
- Visualize air quality changes over time through a simple web frontend.

The backend includes multiple machine learning approaches:
- Supervised learning (Regression & Classification)
- Unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)
- Ensemble methods
- Neural networks
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)

The frontend will display:
- Predicted pollutant values
- Predicted air quality category (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.)
- Air quality visual changes over time
